The <a href="https://www.YoungfleshLab.com">Youngflesh Lab</a> in the <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/science/academics/departments/biosci/index.html">Department of Biological Sciences at Clemson University</a>, operates at the intersection of ecology and data science. We combine ecological theory with leading-edge quantitative tools to understand the processes that structure patterns of biodiversity, broadly defined, and how these dynamics vary across scales. We view these problems largely through the lens of global change and are interested in what this work can tell us regarding which populations, species, and systems are most vulnerable to these changes.

Research in the lab develops reproducible, analytical pipelines that leverage ecological 'big data' using hierarchical Bayesian models and AI. Data streams come from a variety of sources, including participatory science projects, satellites, remote camera networks, and field-based efforts. Our work primarily uses birds and marine mammals as mechanisms to study these dynamics, though interests span a broad range of ecological systems.
